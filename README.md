# What is soldering?

<div class="dark-bg">
  <ul>
    <li>Define Soldering</li>
    <li>Describe why soldering is necessary</li>
    <li>List the ways to stay safe while soldering</li>
  </ul>
</div>

----

## Define Soldering

 A process in which two or more items (usually metal) are joined together by melting and putting a filler metal (solder) into the joint.

----

## Describe Why Soldering is Necessary

* Materials used in electronics require electricity to pass through them
* When working with electronics, we typically want to connect 2 components together
  * A wire and a motor!

----

## List the ways to stay safe while soldering

* Always wear safety glasses.
* Grip the soldering iron by the safety grip. NEVER touch the metal.
* Solder in a well-ventilated space
  * Do not inhale the fumes! Blow them away.
* Always put your soldering iron back in its stand when not in use
* Never, ever try to catch a hot soldering iron if you drop it. Let it fall, buy a new one if you have to — just don’t grab it!
* Give any soldered surface a minute or two to cool down before you touch it.
* Never leave flammable items (such as paper) near your soldering iron.

* Spend 2 minutes searching the web and reading about what is code.

----

# Define and describe computer code

----

## Explain why computer code is required

* Computers (MicroControllers) only understand electricity
* 0s and 1s (binary)
  * 0 - no electricity (off)
  * 1 - electricity (on)
* Computer code can be written and understood by humans
  * Might look foreign, but its a lot easier to learn and code than just 1s and 0s
* The computer code that we write is translated into 0s and 1s so computers can understand it.

----

## List at least 3 computer coding languages (programming languages)

* Spend 2 minutes searching the web and reading about what coding (programming) languages there are.
* List at least 3 coding languages you find

----

# List at least 3 computer coding languages

----

## We will use C++ to program the Arduino!

----

## List at least 5 things computer coding is used for

* Spend 2 minutes searching the web and reading about what coding (programming) languages are used for.
* List at least 5 things you find

----

# List at least 5 things computer coding is used for

# Arduino IDE Setup

1. Open the Arduino IDE
1. Go to Tools->Board and make sure "Arduino Uno" is selected.
1. Download the [CTRobotSimple](CTRobotSimple.ino) file
1. Go to File->Open and open the CTRobotSimple.ino file.
1. Download the [TwoMotorGearbox.zip](TwoMotorGearbox-20180117T085230Z-001.zip) library file
1. Go to Sketch->Import Library->Add Library and select the TwoMotorGearbox.zip library file

# Basics of Programming the Robot with C++

---

### C++ comments

```cpp
// This is a comment
// this compiler ignores things that begin with //
// Programmers use these to leave themselves
// and others notes about the code
```

```cpp
/*
This is also a comment.
Anything between
*/
```

---

### Control the robot

```cpp
// move forward .5 seconds
CCTTwoMotorControl(500, 'F', 250, 'F', 250),
CCTTwoMotorControl(
  500, // time in milliseconds
  'F', // direction M1A - can be 'F' or 'R'
  250, // speed M2A - maximum value is 255
  'F', // direction M1B - can be 'F' or 'R'
  250 // speed M2B - maximum value is 255
)
```

---

### Sleep 😴 💤

This should be after every command, including the last one.

```cpp
CCTTwoMotorControl(100) // sleep for 0.1 seconds
```

---

### Create a list of Commands

By changing the commands and sequence of commands, you can make the robot do anything you want!

```cpp
CCTTwoMotorControl commandList[] = {
  CCTTwoMotorControl(100),
  CCTTwoMotorControl(500, 'F', 250, 'F', 250),  // move forward .5 seconds
  CCTTwoMotorControl(100),
  CCTTwoMotorControl(500, 'R', 250, 'R', 250),  // move backward .5 seconds
  CCTTwoMotorControl(100),
  CCTTwoMotorControl(500, 'F', 250, 'R', 250),  // turn left .5 seconds
  CCTTwoMotorControl(100),
  CCTTwoMotorControl(500, 'R', 250, 'F', 250),  // turn right .5 seconds
  CCTTwoMotorControl(100)
};
```

---

## Sending the program to the robot

1. Plug the USB cable into your Arduino and into the computer.
1. Click on the check mark ✅ "Verify" button in the top left of the Arduino window.
1. Check to make sure it says "Done compiling" at the bottom of the window.
1. Click the arrow "Upload" ➡️ button next to the Verify button. This will load the program onto the robot.
1. If there are errors, go to Tools->Serial Port and choose a different serial port.

---

# CHALLENGES

* Program the robot do a figure 8
* Setup an obstacle course (with cardboard boxes) and make the robot avoid all the obstacles
* Group up with others and perform a synchronized robot dance

---

## Customize and Decorate Robot

* Use duct tape on any part of the robot
* Use foam sheets, cardboard and felt to create a different chassis shape
* Options:
  * Add eyes or antennas with pipe cleaners to make the robot look alive
  * Make the robot look like a real robot (mars rover, autonomous car, humanoid etc.)
